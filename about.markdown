title: About
---


I am currently a course tutor and PG student in the Computer Science Department at IIT Kanpur.
Previously I was working as Senior Software Engineer at Olacabs, Bangalore , and before that, as an Associate at Morgan Stanley, Mumbai.

For most of my professional career, I have coded in Java. However I find it quite verbose. I also had the chance to play with Ruby, however none could match the speed of implementation and expressiveness that Haskell provides. For the same reason, I chose [hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll) to generate my blog.

In April of 2015, I switched to the new Macbook Pro. Previously I used to run linux mint on my machines. Environment consisted mainly of xmonad, bash, vim. [Here](https://github.com/ankitku/dotfiles) is my dotfiles repo. And it goes without saying that I have always owned Android phones.

I grew up in Dhanbad. I studied Electrical Engineering at [IIT (BHU) Varanasi](http://www.iitbhu.ac.in). I actively play table-tennis and cricket. And I enjoy [photography](https://instagram.com/ankitku/), biking and swimming.
