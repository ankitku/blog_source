title: First Prize at Fresher's Night 2015 at IITK
---

Won the first prize for creative writing competition held during the Fresher's Night at IIT Kanpur.
The problem statement was to write a six line, 20 syllable poem with a syllable count by line of 1/1/2/3/5/8 - also called a fibo, on the topic of monsoon rains. Though I had never attempted writing a fibo before, I managed to get the first prize :) The entries I sent were :

tip  
tap  
rain falls  
petrichor  
overwhelms senses  
refreshes body, mind and soul  


आज  
फिर  
हुई  
तेज़ बारिश  
पकोड़े छने   
कागज़ की कश्तियाँ चलीं
