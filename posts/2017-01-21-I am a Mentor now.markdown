The Association for Computing Activities, CSE, IITK is conducting semester long projects for undergrad freshers this new year. I applied as a mentor, and was required to present a brief outline of projects I would be offering.

Based on my presentation, I was allotted 2 students, who will be building interpreters in haskell. One would work on an interpreter for a subset of While language, while the other on the BrainF interpreter. After they will be done, maybe I will also introduce them to dependently typed programming languages like Agda and Coq, and get them to prove few properties about the while language.
