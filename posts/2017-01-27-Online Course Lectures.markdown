title: Online Course Lectures for Esc101 (Introduction to Computing) course
author: Ankit

I am currently a tutor for the Esc101 course (Introduction to Computing) course. As part of my TA duties, I take lectures, create lab problems and grade answer sheets. The medium of instruction at IITK is English, and thus, some students from non english speaking background face difficulties grasping contents of the lectures. This leads to bad grades and sometimes even dropping of the course by such students.

Hence, this semester, under the guidance of Prof.Rajat Mittal and Prof.Sandeep Shukla of CSE Dept., we tutors have teamed up to record lectures for the courses in Hindi, and uploading them to the onlinecourses link of IITK. Hence students can attend lectures held normally in class as well as refer the same lectures in Hindi on the onlinecourses website.

I am attaching a link of one of the lectures I have delivered in this course.
